## Installation

Once the repo is cloned, execute the deploy script:
```
./setup.sh
```

The deploy script creates dotfiles in your home directory that source files in
your ~/dotfiles directory. This makes it easy to provide host specific changes
in those files without having to commit them to the repo.

Where that's not possible we symlink them in.
